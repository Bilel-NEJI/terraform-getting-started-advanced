## Step 17:
- how to Generate an SSH Key with the Terraform TLS Provider
- we are going to add a new provider to help us to generate SSH Key, we are going to use this SSH Key in future Lab, so this is going to be a foundational Lab for upcoming Labs
- see the attached pdf file for more details
- what we are going to do:
    - task 1: check terraform ("terraform.tf" file)
    - task 2: install terraform TLS provider ("terraform.tf" file)
    - task 3: creates a self-signed certificate with TLS Provider ("main.tf" file)
        - we are going to add a couple of resource blocks in the "main.tf" file
