## Step 9:
- Goal of the step: is to talk about input variables; specificly the variable block that we find in our terraform configuration
- what we are going to do is:
    - task 1: add a new VPC resource block with static values
    - task 2: define new variable blocks to declare new variables in our configuration file
    - task 3: modify the value of the variable by adding defaults
- we are still with the same demo-example: VPC and 03 public subnet + 03 private subnet
