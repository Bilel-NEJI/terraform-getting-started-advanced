## Step 35:
- how to work with remote state: enhanced Backend which can do both:
    - store the state
    - perform operation
- when we say an enhaced backend, that emans that specific backend can do the two mentioned tasks
- and basing on what have being said, we can say that the local backend is an enhanced backend too; because it stores the state locally and performs the operations also locally (do both tasks but locally)
- the remote backend in this part of course is another example of enhaced backend (in terraform cloud's runtime environment)
- see the .pdf for more details
