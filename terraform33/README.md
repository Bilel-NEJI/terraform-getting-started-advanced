# This is the explanation file for the folder "terraform33":


## Step 37:
- how to work with "terraform refresh" command and see its effect on the state
- see the .pdf for more details 
- whar we are going to do:
    - task 1: "terraform refresh" command
    - task 2: Show state before refresh
    - task 3: Introduce drift
    - task 4: Refresh state to detect drift
    - task 5: Show state after refresh
    - task 6: Controlling state refresh
        - important details to see here; since "terraform refresh" is depreacated and we can use "terraform plan/apply -refresh-only" instead
