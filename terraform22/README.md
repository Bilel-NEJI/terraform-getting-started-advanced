# This is the explanation file for the folder "terraform22":


## Step 26:
- how to debugg terraform
- see the attached pdf file for more details
- what we are goign to do:
    - task 1: Enable Logging
        - it depends on your OS (linux, windows, etc)
            - linux:
                - by enabling environment variable ==> export TF_LOG=TRACE
                - the environment variable is called "TF_LOG"
            - windows | powershell:
                - by enabling environment variable ==> $env:TF_LOG="TRACE"
                - the environment variable is called "TF_LOG"
        - we can set out environment variable levels in different levels:
            - TRACE
            - DEBUG
            - INFO
            - WARN
            - ERROR
        - by running "terraform init/apply" these commands; the logs will be in the log console
    - task 2: Set Logging Path
        - if we want to have the logs in a log-file, we will set it through an environment variable:
            - linux:
                - by enabling environment variable ==> export TF_LOG_PATH="terraform_log.txt"
                - the environment variable is called "TF_LOG_PATH"
            - windows | powershell:
                - by enabling environment variable ==> $env:TF_LOG_PATH="terraform_log.txt"
                - the environment variable is called "terraform_log.txt"
        - by running "terraform init -upgrade/apply" these commands; the logs will be in that log-file. The logs will not be in the console (back to usual/normal)
        - a new file will be created; "terraform_log.txt"
    - task 3: Disable Logging
        - if we want to turn-off the debugging, we have a command to do that:
            - we will the value of that environment variable to null: 
                - linux:
                    - export TF_LOG=""
                    - export TF_LOG_PATH=""
                - windows:
                    - $env:TF_LOG=""
                    - $env:TF_LOG_PATH=""
